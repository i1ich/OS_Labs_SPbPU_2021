My heart`s in the Highlands, my heart is not here;
My heart`s in the Highlands, a chasing the deer;
Chasing the wild deer, and following the roe;
My heart in the Highlands, wherever I go.
 
Farewell to the Highlands, farewell to the North;
The birth- place of Valour, the country of Worth;
Wherever I wander, wherever I rove,
The hills of the Highlands for ever I love.
 
Farewell to the mountains high cover`d with snow;
Farewell to the Straths and green vallies below:
Farewell to the forests and wild-hanging woods;
Farewell to the torrents and loud-pouring floods.
 
My heart`s in the Highlands, my heart is not here,
My heart`s in the Highlands, a chasing the deer:
Chasing the wild deer, and following the roe;
My heart`s in the Highlands, wherever I go.
